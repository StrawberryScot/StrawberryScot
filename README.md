Hello! Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Benjamin, and I'll be your guide here.

By day, I'm a full-stack developer with an interest in Rust and graphic design. By night, I am the same, but asleep. I have a background in mechanical engineering, with knowledge of Lean management and Kaizen, which I use to enhance the rate at which I turn fun pastimes into rigorous efficiency experiments no one asked for. I have experience working on both team projects and personal ones, adapting to fill the necessary roles for the project to succeed.

I love building keyboards, solving difficult problems, meeting new people, and sharing ideas.

In my spare time, I like to go to the gym, play guitar, or lose my mind trying to figure out why my CSS language server isn't working in Vim, while it gaslights me into thinking it is.
